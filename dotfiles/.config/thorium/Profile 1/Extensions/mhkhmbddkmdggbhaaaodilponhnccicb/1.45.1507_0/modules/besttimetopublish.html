                The first hour that your video is live is the most critical. The next most critical hour is the second hour. Followed by the third hour
                and so on. Our proprietary algorithm examines YouTube's "When your viewers are on YouTube" data (purple graph above) and calculates a score
                for every single hour of the week.
                <div style="padding-top: 4px;">
                    Our recommendations show when the score is highest. Of course there are different theories and ways to calculate when the best time to publish
                    would be, but this is our particular take on it.

                <br />
                <div style="padding-bottom:4px; font-weight:bold">Upload Time vs Livestream Time</div>
                Our Upload Time recommendations look at <span class="tb-best-time-to-publish-upload-interval">12</span> hour blocks of time (again, where the first hour is weighted the most all the way through to the <span class="tb-best-time-to-publish-upload-interval">12</span>th hour
                which is weighted the least). We figure the bulk of your subscribers will view your video during this time period so you should publish and optimize focused around
                this block of time.
                <div style="padding-top: 4px;">
                    Our Livestream Time recommendations look at 2 hour blocks of time. This assumes that most people stream for an hour or so. The idea is that
                    you want to livestream right when your audience is most active.

                Ultimately, consistency is more important than anything. If you can stick to a consistent publishing schedule that your
                fans remember and can count on, that's probably your best bet.
