<!-- If adding any css to the plugin for example styles.css, add a second file named styles.safari.css. In that
	file do a find and replace replacing ; with !important; Then do a second find and replace to get rid of any
	duplicate !importants that were created as a result of the first find and replace. This is necessary due to 
	the way safari handles css in plugins. So in the safari extension, reference the .safari file. In all others
	just reference the .css.-->
